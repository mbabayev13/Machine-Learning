        "In Machine Learning and Data Science we often come across a term called **Imbalanced Data Distribution**, generally happens when observations in one of the class are much higher or lower than the other classes. As Machine Learning algorithms tend to increase accuracy by reducing the error, they do not consider the class distribution. This problem is prevalent in examples such as **Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection, Facial recognition** etc. Standard ML techniques such as Decision Tree and Logistic Regression have a bias towards the **majority** class, and they tend to ignore the minority class. They tend only to predict the majority class, hence, having major misclassification of the minority class in comparison with the majority class. In more technical words, if we have imbalanced data distribution in our dataset then our model becomes more prone to the case when minority class has negligible or very lesser **recall. Imbalanced Data Handling Techniques**: There are mainly 2 mainly algorithms that are widely used for handling imbalanced class distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) is one of the most commonly used oversampling methods to solve the imbalance problem. It aims to balance class distribution by randomly increasing minority class examples by replicating them. SMOTE synthesises new minority instances between existing minority instances. It generates the **virtual training records by linear interpolation** for the minority class. These synthetic training records are generated by randomly selecting one or more of the k-nearest neighbors for each example in the minority class. After the oversampling process, the data is reconstructed and several classification models can be applied for the processed data. **More Deep Insights of how SMOTE Algorithm work !**\n"

When instances of two different classes are very close to each other, we remove the instances of the majority class to increase the spaces between the two classes.

To prevent problem of **information loss** in most under-sampling techniques, **near-neighbor** methods are widely used. **The basic intuition about the working of near-neighbor methods is as follows**:\n"
